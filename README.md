## 🔒 LawScrapper
LawScrapper is an automated legal monitoring and summarization pipeline. It periodically checks for new legal acts published by the Polish Sejm, filters them by topic (e.g., fire safety), summarizes their content using an LLM (Claude via LangChain), and sends email notifications with formatted summaries.
---
## 🚀 Features
✅ Fetches recent legal acts using Sejm API
✅ Filters acts by keywords
✅ Automatically downloads PDF versions of the acts
✅ Extracts and summarizes content with Claude 3.5 (via LangChain)
✅ Sends email notifications with summaries and metadata in a styled HTML table
✅ LangGraph-based pipeline to handle conditional workflows (e.g., if no acts found)
---
## 🛠 Requirements
Install dependencies (Python ≥ 3.10 recommended):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Also make sure to configure environment variables:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
SMTP_SERVER=...
SMTP_PORT=...
SMTP_USER=...
SMTP_PASSWORD=...
SMTP_FROM=...
SMTP_TO=...
```
You will need access to Anthropic's Claude model via LangChain integration (langchain-anthropic).
---
### 📺 How to Use
You can manually run the workflow from main.py:
```bash
python main.py
```
It will:
✅ Fetch recent acts from the last week.
✅ If acts are found, each one is summarized.
✅ A summary notification is sent via email.
✅ If no acts are found, a separate info message is sent.
✅ You can adjust the keyword(s) and time range directly in the script logic.

### 📂 Output
Email summaries are sent to the configured recipient (SMTP_TO) and contain:
1) Title,
2) Summary (generated by LLM),
3) Dates (eg. entry into force date),
4) Keywords,
5) Link to PDF/HTML text of the act

## 📍 Planned Improvements
1) CLI support for scheduling or manual triggering,
2) Persistent database (e.g., SQLite) to track already processed acts
